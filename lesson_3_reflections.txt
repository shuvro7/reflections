When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that I can work on cloud on any pc or even share with or work with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By manual pull changes i could picturising the whole situation more nicely rather than automatically.
Moreover Automatic pull changes could take unwanted files and could introduce conglomerate buggy situation.
